A monetary loan is when one or more persons, organizations,or other entities lend money to other people, organizations, or entities. The recipient (i.e., the borrower) incurs a debt for which he or she is generally responsible for paying interest until the loan is repaid along with the principal amount borrowed. 
Nowadays, sanctioning of loans has become a significant function of the financial institutions/banking sector. Loans are also one of the significant sources of income for banks. 
Banks apply interests on loans which are the sanctioned to their customers (borrowers). While sanctioning a loan, the lender needs to have an assurance of earning their money back along with interest. 
Thus, identifying the credit worthiness of an individual/an organization is highly important before sanctioning the loan.

Logistic regression is a supervised learning classification algorithm used to predict the probability of a target variable. The nature of target or dependent variable is dichotomous, which means there would be only two possible classes.
In simple words, the dependent variable is binary in nature having data coded as either 1 (stands for success/yes) or 0 (stands for failure/no).
Mathematically, a logistic regression model predicts P(Y=1) as a function of X. It is one of the simplest ML algorithms that can be used for various classification problems .

A decision tree is a flowchart-like structure in which each internal node represents a test on a feature (e.g. whether a coin flip comes up heads or tails) , each leaf node represents a class label (decision taken after computing all features) and branches represent conjunctions of features that lead to those class labels.
The paths from root to leaf represent classification rules
